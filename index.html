            <p>PRODUCT/TEST ENGINEERING MANAGER
                12 years of experience in An experienced ATE development for mixed-signal ICs, including 10+ years in engineering leadership roles, I am deeply committed to putting customers first and leading cross-functional teams to deliver complex projects and platforms promptly and within budget. With a M.S. in Electrical Engineering, and hands-on skills with ATE platforms such as Teradyne, LTX-Credence, I bring a solid foundation to any semiconductor test/product engineering management role. My knowledge of analog electronics, experience with board-level design and debug, and proficiency in statistical analysis of test data enhance my ability to drive successful project outcomes. Additionally, my hands-on experience with electronics lab instrumentation, including prior exposure to metrology systems for evaluating timing parameters, further strengthens my technical capabilities. I possess excellent programming skills, particularly in C++, with experience in Python, which further enhance my capacity to develop and optimize test programs efficiently. Coupled with my ability to work effectively as part of a team and my strong sense of urgency to meet test requirements on schedule, I am well-equipped to excel in technical product/project management roles.
